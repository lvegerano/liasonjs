Purpose for the lib

There are a few ORM out there and for me they seem extremely bloated and try to achieve a lot. This lib aims to be simple
to use and feel very intuitive to the user.

The lib will do some of the thinking for the user and will be flexible where needed.

Each method will have one way of doing things.

A user should be able to:

1. create a schema
2. define indexes
2. define a model
3. define relationships
4. perform CRUD operations

MVP
